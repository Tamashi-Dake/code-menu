[]: # Project Name: Todenu

Some features are not available yet, but i'm gonna list them here anyway:  
- [x] Authentication with Google account  
- [x] set time out for session (30 minutes, but i can't make alert work)
- [x] Drag and drop to add / change order of job?  
- [ ] Making Bill 
- [ ] Deal with time input
- [ ] CRUD custom menu (if logged in)  
- [ ] Pagination with selected tabs
- [ ] Choose job to do  
- [ ] Update bill with total job and price(time)  
- [ ] Checkout to start timecounter(sẽ xem xét cho từng job)  
- [ ] Random to randomize job within freetime (require fill freetime first)  

Flow:  
  - Guess:  
        - select, start sample job menu  
        - log in with Google account  
  - User:   
        - CRUD User menu  
        - Use their own menu  
        - Todenu statistics?  


I might fix these bugs later:
- [ ] Bill bug: when draging to the bottom right, the element can go out of bound
- [ ] Bill bug: click event trigger drag event thus making user have to click multiple times to delete
