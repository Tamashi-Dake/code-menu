The thing is... this still connect to MongoDB atlas, not MongoDB in local <br/>
i just can't make it work at the moment<br/>
so i'm gonna stick with only one project for the time being ig

trying `&nbsp;` for spacing in md file

Main feature:  
[x]Authentication with Google account
[ ]CRUD custom menu (if logged in)  
[ ]choose job to do  
[ ]update bill with total job and price(time)  
[ ]checkout to start timecounter(sẽ xem xét cho từng job)  
[ ]random to randomize job within freetime (require fill freetime first)  

Luồng:
    Guess:  select, start sample job menu
            register
    User:   Login
            CRUD User menu
            use their own menu

note to self:<br/>
should use combo: debuger + text compare + print to console when asking AI to do something
