The thing is... this still connect to MongoDB atlas, not MongoDB in local  
i just can't make it work at the moment  
so i'm gonna stick with only one project for the time being ig  

Some features are not available yet, but i'm gonna list them here anyway:  
- [x] Authentication with Google account  
- [x] set time out for session (30 minutes, but i can't make alert work)
- [ ] Making Bill
- [ ] Deal with time input
- [ ] CRUD custom menu (if logged in)  
- [ ] Pagination with selected tabs
- [ ] Choose job to do  
- [ ] Update bill with total job and price(time)  
- [ ] Checkout to start timecounter(sẽ xem xét cho từng job)  
- [ ] Random to randomize job within freetime (require fill freetime first)  
- [ ] Drag and drop to add / remove / change order of job?  

Flow:  
  - Guess:  
        - select, start sample job menu
        - log in with Google account
  - User:   
        - CRUD User menu
        - Use their own menu
        - Todenu statistics?




note to self:  
should use combo: debuger + text compare + print to console when asking AI to do something
